## Description
A BLE scanner App that Scans for and connect to BLE devices via bluetooth

## What I learned
- Standard Bluetooth vs BLE
- Standard Bluetooth - Allways on, drains more battery
- BLE - Only on when necessary and conserves battery
- under ScanResult class there is an onScResults method you can override to rettrieve desired data you want
- In the app i obtained the device name, address,rssi, isConnectable, manufacturer, serviceUuids
